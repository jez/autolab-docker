# Autolab + Docker

This repo contains a `docker-compose.yml` file suitable for using with Docker.
The file expects the `autolab/Autolab` and `autolab/Tango` repositories to be
cloned into this repo once you deploy it.

For more information about using Docker to deploy Autolab, see the [Autolab
wiki][autolab-wiki]
