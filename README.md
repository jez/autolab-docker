# Autolab + Docker

This repo contains a `docker-compose.yml` file suitable for deploying Autolab
with Docker.

The setup expects the `autolab/Autolab` and `autolab/Tango` repositories to be
cloned into this repo eventually. For more information about using Docker to
deploy Autolab, see the [Autolab wiki][autolab-wiki].
